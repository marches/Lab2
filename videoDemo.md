Our video demonstration of parallel and series load modes can be viewed at the following location:

Test Sequence:
1. Flip switch 0 to on.
2. Flip switch 1 to on and back to off. 
3. Flip switch 0 to off. 
>> You should see led 0 light up.
4. Flip switch 1 to on and back to off 3 times.
>> You should see one led light up per switch in order from 1 to 3.
5. Press button 3.
>> You should see all leds turn off.
6. Flip switch 1 to on and back to off.
>> You should see led 0 light up.
7. Flip switch 1 to on and back to off 3 times.
>> You should see one led light up per switch in order from 1 to 3.
8. Press button 2.
>> You should see all leds turn off.
9. Press button 1.
>> You should see leds 0 and 2 light up.
10. Press button 3.
>> You should see led 2 light up.





Please note that we used a slightly different parallel constant due to human error. We have not changed this because our demonstration demonstrates the functionality of our system and the process of recompiling and sending the correct parallel load was deemed to be not worth our time. In addition, we used button 1 instead of button 0 as at multiple points in our synthesis/loading process we had concerns about the operational functionality of button 0. This is another thing that we deemed to not be worth our time to go back and reset. We decided that these minor differences in design were not worth our time to remedy because it would not lead to additional learning for us.
